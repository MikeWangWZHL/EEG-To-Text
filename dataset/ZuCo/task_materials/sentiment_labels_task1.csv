286;The inhospitability of the land emphasizes the spare precision of the narratives and helps to give them an atavistic power, as if they were tales that had been handed down since the beginning of time.;;0
287;Even more baffling is that it's funny.;;0
288;Parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material, but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone... that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story's core.;;0

374;A profoundly stupid affair, populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility.;;-1
375;Warm Water Under a Red Bridge is a quirky and poignant Japanese film that explores the fascinating connections between women, water, nature, and sexuality.;;1
376;It isn't that Stealing Harvard is a horrible movie -- if only it were that grand a failure!;;-1
377;It just doesn't have much else... especially in a moral sense.;;0
378;Those unfamiliar with Mormon traditions may find The Singles Ward occasionally bewildering.;;0
